I'm working on improving my screentime this coming year. 

Way more of your info than you'd think is stored in plain dbs on your laptop.

Here's a little tool I built to safely extract useful info and give you some stats:

- App usage time
- Most visited sites
- Messages (who and when)
- Podcasts

Any requests for other context?
