These are things I would like to add to this application.

1. Add API connections for this database aggregation
- Gmail (add in emails and threads)
- Whoop (other fitness), add in other fitness links
- Notes / other unstructured data (google drive(?), notion, etc)
- More watch history ? Prime etc
- What else will become accessible because of local usage (eg copilot I can get all my financial transactions)
- copilot


Separately to this project
- Set up a linux server capable of running claude code, give it this code (or similar code) and create a small utility for it to allow it to run, commit, and message me about what it is doing. So I can text it back and forth.
